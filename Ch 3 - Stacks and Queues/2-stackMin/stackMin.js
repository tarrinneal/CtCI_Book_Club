//How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element? push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.

var Stack = require('./../util/Stack');

// Approach, keep an additional stack that keeps the mins

class StackMin extends Stack {
  constructor() {
    super();
    // finish this
  }

  push(value) {
    //
  }

  pop() {
    //
  }

  min() {
    //
  }
}
