  // a b c and d here are Variables, you can think of them as a storage location for the Values
  // that they are set to. Or more specifically, a pointer to the information.

  // The types shown here [String, Int, Double, and Boolean], are the most common types used
  // in coding. They are fairly simple, and do what you would expect (mostly).
  //

  // First task,
  // Declare a variable "E" with the value of 5.
  // Declare a variable "F" with the value of -5.

  return; //update this line to return "E" and "F" added together.
}

// Although - in JavaScript - you can change the Type of the of a variable at will,
// it is highly recommended that you do not do that. Most languages are "strongly typed",
// which means you have to declare upfront what the type will be and it cannot change.
