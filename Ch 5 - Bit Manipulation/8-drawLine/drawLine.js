/*
A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will
be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array
and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from ( xl, y) to ( x2, y).
The method signature should look something like:
drawline(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)
*/
var drawLine = function (screen, width, x1, x2, y) {
  //Still better than I can draw irl
};

module.exports = drawLine;
